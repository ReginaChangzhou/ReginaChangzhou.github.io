			<h5>Flappy Band (2018)</h5>
			<p>
			Flappy Band is a prototyped system designed with the purpose of enhancing communication between 1st/2nd
			grade students and teachers about ideas and issues occurring outside the classroom. The system is composed by two parts: a student-oriented voice-controlled wearable watch, with which students can talk to a cartoon pigeon on screen and use it to send voice messages to teachers; and a teacher-oriented desktop interface with which teachers can check and respond to messages sent from students. The prototype serves as an instantaneously accessible and easy-to-use tool for students to communicate with teachers, as well as a convenient approach for teachers and the school to check in with and send mass notification to students.  
			</p>
			<p>
			In this project, I worked as the leading UX researcher along with other 3 brilliant master students. We spent 10+ hours observing in a elementary school, interviewed a group of 1st and 2nd graders and teachers, and surveyed teachers. We developed personas for both teachers and students. After brainstorming and comparing pros and cons for 20+ ideas we sketched, we developed a paper prototype of the students' band and teacher's interface. We ran usability tests on both students and teachers with the paper prototype, and iterated on our design. Our final high-fidelity prototype included a 3D-printed watch prototype and a digital interface for teacher, as well as a video prototype demonstrating how the system works.

			<h5>Plug-N-Talk (2017)</h5>
			<p>
			Plug-N-Talk is a smartphone application prototype that serves as an affordable solution to the pricey hearing aids market. By using our app, a pair of earphones and a microphone, users can enjoy a real-time in person conversation with background noises effectively reduced. Users can also easily adjust the enhancement of specific frequencies according to their hearing needs.

			This project was part of UCSD Design Competition: Design for Senior Citizens in 2017. I worked as the leading UX researcher along with other 8 inspiring students. We spent 20+ hours observing in a retirement community, and interviewed a group of seniors. We regularly followed-up with a senior member of the community and studied difficulties and needs in her daily life using a rapid ethnographic approach. We identified the problem that current hearing aids on market are all very pricy, and usually cannot meet the user's needs for reduced background noise during conversations and enhancement for a specific frequency band of sound. We held brainstorming sessions with seniors and tested our low-fidelity prototype in a wizard-of-oz fashion. The final high-fi product, an ios app prototype equipped with a pair of earphones and a microphone, is the result of countless iterations and coordination between the design team and the engineering team.

			<p>
			Mind Map is a simple brain-computer interface software prototype combined with the Emotive headset and a 3D printer to observe a personâ€™s brain activity and create a 3D printed object that represents that activity. The user will be able to see how differences in thoughts, emotions or other activities can physically change the model, indicating brain activity changes.
