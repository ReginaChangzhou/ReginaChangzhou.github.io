			<h5>Problem framing in online distributed design team</h5>
			<p>
			In this project I worked with Prof. <a href="http://spdow.ucsd.edu" class="linkto" target = "blank">Steven Dow</a> at <a href="http://protolab.ucsd.edu" class="linkto" target = "blank">UCSD Protolab</a> (part of <a href="http://designlab.ucsd.edu" class="linkto" target = "blank">UCSD Design Lab</a>) and (remotely!) with Dr. <a href="http://joelchan.me" class="linkto" target = "blank">Joel Chan</a> at CMU HCII. We studied how to incorporate experts’ knowledge to improve <a href="https://www.id.iit.edu/artifacts/what-is-problem-framing-in-design" class="linkto" target = "blank">problem framing</a> in distributed collaborative design. In order to find a systematic way to select effective frames in distributed online design platforms, we collected opinions on frames from experts with different knowledge bases, and tested whether those opinions predict the effectiveness of frames by evaluating quality of resulting ideas generated from real users of our design platform. Check our working paper accepted by ACM Group 2018 conference for our findings!

			<h5>Data science communication through computational notebooks</h5>
			<p>
			 In this project I worked with Prof. <a href="http://hci.ucsd.edu/hollan" class="linkto" target = "blank">Jim Hollan</a> and his Ph.D student Adam Rule at the<a href="http://activityhistory.github.io/" class="linkto" target = "blank"> Activity History</a> group of <a href="http://designlab.ucsd.edu" class="linkto" target = "blank">UCSD Design Lab</a>. We studied the narrative features among the Jupyter Notebooks using by the scientific data analysts community. We are also building Jupyter Notebook extensions to enhance communication on scienctific data analysis. Check back for our reports and extensions!

			<h5>Data science education through computational notebooks</h5>
			<p>
			 In this project I also worked with the Activity History team. We studied the usage of Jupyter Notebooks in a introductory data science class. We observed how instructors and students use Jupyter Notebooks for teaching/learning data science and summarized the "painful points" in this process. We are working on submitting our findings to CHI 2018 student research competition. We are also builidng Jupyter Notebook extensions to solve some problems we observed. Here is a extension I built to assist beginning learners clean up import packages, check back for more extensions!

			<h5>Application of EEG neurofeedback on working memory defect treatment for schizophrenia</h5>
			<p>
			This was my frist research experience! I worked with Prof. <a href="http://cognitiveneurolab.ucsd.edu" class="linkto" target = "blank">Jaime Pineda</a> and Dr. Fiza Singh at the UCSD Cognitive Neuroscience lab on a project about EEG neurofeedback. We studied the effect of EEG-gamma neurofeedback on working memory in patients with schizophrenia. In this study I wrote MATLAB scripts to adapt a machine learning algorithm created by a collaborator in Spain to the data we collected from patients, which provided solid evidence to the effects of our neurofeedback! We are currently working on submitting a full paper for publication.

		<div class="col-sm-9">
			<p>
			Plug-N-Talk is a smartphone application prototype that serves as an affordable solution to the pricey hearing aids market. By using our app, a pair of earphones and a microphone, users can enjoy a realtime in person conversation with background noises effectively reduced. Users can also easily adjust the enhancement of specific frequencies according to their hearing needs.

			<p>
			Mind Map is a simple brain-computer interface software prototype combined with the Emotive headset and a 3D printer to observe a person’s brain activity and create a 3D printed object that represents that activity. The user will be able to see how differences in thoughts, emotions or other activities can physically change the model, indicating brain activity changes.
