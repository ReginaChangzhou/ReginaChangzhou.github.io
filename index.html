				Hi, I'm Regina! I'm a researcher in Human-computer Interaction (HCI).
				I design and research community-driven and AI-powered technology to help people work with data and code. To do so, I conduct mixed method empirical research as well as develop research prototypes. More broadly, my research spans across the areas of programming support and education, creativity tools, and social computing.
			</p>

			<p>
				Currently I'm an AIML resident at Apple, where I do research on UI support for developers in the Human Centered Machine Learning group. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I (very recently!) received my PhD from the <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/" class="linkto" target = "blank">Human Centered Design &amp Engineering</a> (HCDE) department at University of Washington (UW). I was advised by <a href="https://mako.cc/" class="linkto" target = "blank">Dr. Benjamin Mako Hill</a> and <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/turns" class="linkto" target = "blank">Dr. Jennifer Turns</a>, and closely worked with <a href="https://unmad.in/" class="linkto" target = "blank">Dr. Sayamindu Dasgupta</a>. I have been part of the <a href="https://wiki.communitydata.science/Main_Page" class="linkto" target = "blank">Community Data Science Collective</a> research group. I received my Bachelor of Science degrees in Cognitive Science and Mathematics from University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where I did research in the <a href="https://designlab.ucsd.edu/" class="linkto" target = "blank">Design Lab</a>.  
			</p>

			<!--p>
				<b>I'm on the job market! I'm looking for academic/industrial research positions. Please reach out if you know any opportunities!</b> 
			</p-->

			<!--p>
				My work has resulted in design guidelines for community platform design and regulation, as well as human factors in AI tools such as GitHub Copilot. My research has been published in various academic venues such as CHI, CSCW, and NAACL. 
			
				More generally, I'm interested in topics about online community, computational literacies, human-AI collaboration, and creativity support. 
			</p-->
			
			<p>
				In my free time, I enjoy creating <a href = "https://twitter.com/RaeManga/media" class = "linkto" target = "blank">digital fanarts and illustrations</a> and cuddling with my cat, <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/hime_theprincesscat/"class = "linkto" target = "blank">Hime</a>. <!--I also like reading, cooking, hiking, and researching the evolution of languages around the world, especially the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Chinese" class = "linkto" target = "blank">Wu variety of Chinese</a> (or rather, its own language, but that's <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varieties_of_Chinese#Terminology" class = "linkto" target = "blank">a longer conversation</a>).-->
